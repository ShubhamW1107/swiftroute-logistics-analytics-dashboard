1️⃣ Headline
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze logistics operations — focusing on delivery performance, hub efficiency, driver productivity, fleet reliability, and customer satisfaction.

2️⃣ Purpose
The SwiftRoute Logistics Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report designed to monitor and optimize end-to-end logistics operations.
This dashboard enables operational managers and business stakeholders to track KPIs such as on-time delivery rate, hub capacity utilization, driver performance, and vehicle breakdown trends to support data-driven decision-making.
3️⃣ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary data visualization and reporting platform
• 📂 Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and shaping
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPI calculations, MoM growth, dynamic measures
• 🗂 Data Modeling – Relationships established between Orders, Hubs, Drivers, and Vehicles tables
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews
4️⃣ Data Source
Source: Simulated logistics operational dataset (Orders, Hubs, Drivers, Vehicles).
The dataset consists of multiple relational tables:
• Orders – Order details, delivery time, delay status, customer satisfaction
• Hubs – Hub capacity and processing performance
• Drivers – Experience, performance rating, employment type
• Vehicles – Fleet details, breakdown count, maintenance history
The data model enables cross-analysis between operational entities to generate meaningful business insights.
5️⃣ Features
• Business Problem
Logistics companies often struggle with:
Delivery delays impacting customer satisfaction
Hubs operating beyond capacity
Driver performance inconsistencies
Vehicle breakdowns causing operational disruptions
Lack of centralized KPI monitoring
Raw operational data alone makes it difficult for management to quickly identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
• Goal of the Dashboard
To build an interactive business intelligence solution that:
Provides centralized visibility into logistics KPIs
Enables performance comparison across hubs and drivers
Tracks delivery efficiency trends month-over-month
Identifies operational risks related to fleet and capacity
Supports strategic and operational decision-making

1️⃣ Headline<br>
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze logistics operations — focusing on delivery performance, hub efficiency, driver productivity, fleet reliability, and customer satisfaction.

2️⃣ Purpose<br>
The SwiftRoute Logistics Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report designed to monitor and optimize end-to-end logistics operations.
This dashboard enables operational managers and business stakeholders to track KPIs such as on-time delivery rate, hub capacity utilization, driver performance, and vehicle breakdown trends to support data-driven decision-making.

3️⃣ Tech Stack<br>
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
•	📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
•	📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br>
•	🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
•	📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.<br>
•	📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4️⃣ Data Source<br>
Source: Simulated logistics operational dataset (Orders, Hubs, Drivers, Vehicles).<br>
The dataset consists of multiple relational tables:<br>
• Orders – Order details, delivery time, delay status, customer satisfaction<br>
• Hubs – Hub capacity and processing performance<br>
• Drivers – Experience, performance rating, employment type<br>
• Vehicles – Fleet details, breakdown count, maintenance history<br>
The data model enables cross-analysis between operational entities to generate meaningful business insights.<br>

5️⃣ Features<br>
• Business Problem<br>
Logistics companies often struggle with:<br>
Delivery delays impacting customer satisfaction<br>
Hubs operating beyond capacity<br>
Driver performance inconsistencies<br>
Vehicle breakdowns causing operational disruptions<br>
Lack of centralized KPI monitoring<br>
Raw operational data alone makes it difficult for management to quickly identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.<br>
• Goal of the Dashboard<br>
To build an interactive business intelligence solution that:<br>
Provides centralized visibility into logistics KPIs<br>
Enables performance comparison across hubs and drivers<br>
Tracks delivery efficiency trends month-over-month<br>
Identifies operational risks related to fleet and capacity<br>
Supports strategic and operational decision-making<br>
